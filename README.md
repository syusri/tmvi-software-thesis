# TMVI Software

## Background
Transcatheter mitral valve implants (TMVI) are an emerging treatment for individuals with mitral regurgitation (MR). The compatibility between the implant and the patient's cardiac physiology is vital to ensuring long-term success. This compatibility can be determined by predicting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction using calculations of gradient.

The software in this repository is an application prototype which focuses on the user interface, intended for clinician use.

This thesis project is part of a larger project run in collaboration with UNSW Sydney researchers and cardiologists from Liverpool Hospital.
